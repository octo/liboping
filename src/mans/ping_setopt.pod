=head1 NAME

ping_setopt - Set options for a liboping object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #include <oping.h>

  int ping_setopt (pingobj_t *obj, int opt, void *val);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<ping_setopt> method sets options that effect all hosts associated with
the object I<obj> and hosts that are yet to be added to the object.

The I<obj> argument is a pointer to an liboping object, as returned by
L<ping_construct(3)>.

The I<opt> argument specifies the option to set. Use one of the following
constants:

=over 4

=item B<PING_OPT_TIMEOUT>

The time to wait for a "echo reply" to be received; in seconds. In this case
the memory pointed to by I<val> is interpreted as a double value and must be
greater than zero. The default is B<PING_DEF_TIMEOUT>.

=item B<PING_OPT_TTL>

The value written into the time-to-live (= TTL) field of generated ICMP
packets. The memory pointed to by I<val> is interpreted as an integer. Valid
values are 1 through 255. Default is B<PING_DEF_TTL>.

=item B<PING_OPT_AF>

The address family to use. The memory pointed to by I<val> is interpreted as an
integer and must be either B<AF_UNSPEC>, B<AF_INET>, or B<AF_INET6>. This
option only effects hosts that are being added B<after> this option has been
set. Default is B<PING_DEF_AF>.

=back

The I<val> argument is a pointer to the new value. It must not be NULL. It is
dereferences depending on the value of the I<opt> argument, see above. The
memory pointed to by I<val> is not changed.

=head1 RETURN VALUE

B<ping_setopt> returns zero upon success or less than zero upon failure.
