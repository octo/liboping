=head1 NAME

ping_host_add - Add a host to a liboping object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #include <oping.h>

  int ping_host_add       (pingobj_t *obj, const char *host);
  int ping_host_add_multi (pingobj_t *obj, const char *host, int max_hosts);
  int ping_host_remove    (pingobj_t *obj, const char *host);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<ping_host_add> method tries to resolve the I<host> argument, open a
socket and associate everything with the liboping object I<obj>.

The I<obj> argument is a pointer to an liboping object, as returned by
L<ping_construct(3)>.

The I<host> parameter is a '\0' terminated string which is interpreted as a
hostname or an IP address. Depending on the address family setting, set with
L<ping_setopt(3)>, the hostname is resolved to an IPv4 or IPv6 address.

If more than one result is returned by DNS, only the first result is used.

The B<ping_host_add_multi> extends the B<ping_host_add> function to
permit adding up to I<max_hosts> DNS results (IPv4 and IPv6, or multiple
IPv4 / IPv6 records) to the liboping object.  If I<max_hosts> is 0, there
is no limit = add all records returned by DNS.

The B<ping_host_remove> method looks for I<host> within I<obj> and remove it if
found. It will close the socket and deallocate the memory, too.

The names passed to B<ping_host_add> and B<ping_host_remove> must match. This
name can be queried using L<ping_iterator_get_info(3)>.

=head1 RETURN VALUE

If B<ping_host_add> succeeds it returns zero. If an error occurs a value less
than zero is returned and the last error is saved internally. You can receive
the error message using L<ping_get_error(3)>.

If B<ping_host_add_multi> succeeds it returns the number of hosts added. If 
an error occurs a value less than zero is returned and the last error is 
saved internally. You can receive the error message using L<ping_get_error(3)>.

B<ping_host_remove> returns zero upon success and less than zero if it failed.
Currently the only reason for failure is that the host isn't found, but this is
subject to change. Use L<ping_get_error(3)> to receive the error message.
