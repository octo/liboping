=head1 NAME

oping - send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<oping> [B<-4> | B<-6>] [B<-c> I<count>] [B<-i> I<interval>] I<host> [I<host> [I<host> ...]]

B<oping> [B<-4> | B<-6>] [B<-c> I<count>] [B<-i> I<interval>] B<-f> I<filename>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

oping uses ICMPv4 or ICMPv6 ECHO_REQUEST packets to measure a hosts
reachability and the network latency. In contrast to the original L<ping(8)>
utility B<oping> can send ICMP packets to multiple hosts in parallel and wait
for all ECHO_RESPONSE packets to arrive. In contrast to the
B<fping> utility (URL is listed in L<"SEE ALSO">) B<oping> can use both, IPv4
and IPv6 transparently and side by side.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-4>

Force the use of IPv4. 

=item B<-6>

Force the use of IPv6.

=item B<-c> I<count>

Send (and receive) I<count> ICMP packets, then stop and exit.

=item B<-i> I<interval>

Send one ICMP packet (per host) each I<interval> seconds. This can be a
floating-point number to specify sub-second precision.

=item B<-t> I<ttl>

Set the IP Time to Live to I<ttl>. This must be a number between (and
including) 1E<nbsp>andE<nbsp>255. If omitted, the value B<64> is used.

=item B<-I> I<address>

Set the source address to use. You may either specify an IP number or a
hostname. You B<cannot> pass the interface name, as you can with GNU's
L<ping(8)> - use the B<-D> option for that purpose.

=item B<-D> I<interface name>

Set the outgoing network device to use.

=item B<-f> I<filename>

Instead of specifying hostnames on the command line, read them from
I<filename>. If I<filename> is B<->, read from C<STDIN>.

If the real user ID (as returned by L<getuid(2)>) and the effective user ID (as
returned by L<geteuid(2)>) differ, the only argument allowed for this option is
"-" (i.E<nbsp>e. standard input). This is meant to avoid security issues when
I<oping> is installed with the SUID-bit.
