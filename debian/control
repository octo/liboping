Description: C/C++ library to generate ICMP ECHO_REQUESTs (development files)
 liboping features pinging multiple hosts in parallel using IPv4 or IPv6
 transparently. The interface is object oriented.
 .
 This package contains the header files, the static library and the manpages.

Description: sends ICMP_ECHO requests to network hosts
 oping uses ICMP packages (better known as "ping packets") to test the
 reachability of network hosts. It supports pinging multiple hosts in parallel
 using IPv4 and/or IPv6 transparently.
 .
 This package contains two command line applications: "oping" is a replacement
 for tools like ping(1), ping6(1) and fping(1). "noping" is an ncurses-based
 tool which displays statistics while pinging and highlights aberrant
 round-trip times.

Description: module for ICMP latency measurement
 Net::Oping is a Perl module for sending ICMP ECHO_REQUESTs (better known as
 "ping packets") and measuring the time that elapses until the reception of an
 ICMP ECHO_REPLY packet (also known as "pong"). It supports pinging multiple
 hosts in parallel using IPv4 or IPv6 transparently.
